# 3D Cloud Electron Model of Bromine

This is an HTML/CSS/JS app, but I put it in one file! Feel free to download index.html to run it.

I love elemental bromine (its one of my favorite carcinogens) so I decided to model it. If you wonder why it looks messy and not like what the Bohr's model depicts it to be, you should know that electrons are so small that they are doing quantum jumps extremely fast and vibrating, so you have to make a model that essentially just plots where it COULD be. If you were able to look at an atom with your naked (or clothed) eye, you would see that it has some kind of cloud around it.
